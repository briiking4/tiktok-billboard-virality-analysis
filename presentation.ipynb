This project aims to explore the factors that contribute to a song’s virality on TikTok and compare them with trends seen on the Billboard Hot 100 charts. By understanding these patterns, we can offer strategic recommendations to enhance TikTok’s music engagement, help artists, and foster social connections between users through shared music experiences."

    "Insight: Gera MX experienced a decline in popularity after his viral hit. This suggests that while the viral nature of the song boosted his visibility and engagement at the time, it did not translate into sustained artist popularity.

This sharp decline might indicate that his hit did not sufficiently establish him as a recurring artist in the industry. While Gera MX only dropped in popularity by 7 points, Masked Wolf significantly dropped in popularity, suggesting that TikTok had a significant role in sustaining the artist's popularity over time, despite the drop. \n",

    "**Opportunity:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis of artist popularity following their viral hits on TikTok and Billboard reveals a critical insight: while achieving viral success can significantly boost an artist's visibility, sustaining that popularity remains a challenge.

    "- **Nurturing Emerging Artists:** Songs with overlap on TikTok and Billboard viral hits tend to have higher, sustained popularity. There’s an opportunity for TikTok to elevate emerging artists who have organically gained TikTok virality and transition to mainstream consumption to sustain their artist popularity over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Business Recommendations:**\n",
    "1. **Launch \"TikTok Spotlight Series\" Program**\n",
    "TikTok could launch an artist development program that focuses on raising emerging talent as their tracks gain viral momentum. This program could offer promotion and personalized marketing support. By featuring artists who organically grow on the platform, TikTok can offer them a boost by helping them turn viral, short-lived, moments into long-term success for the artist. Conduct short interviews with artists discussing the inspiration behind their songs, the meaning of their lyrics, and their experiences with sharing their music on TikTok. These interviews can be segmented into bite-sized clips for easy sharing and viewing on TikTok. The Spotlight Series would allow TikTok to secure its position as a key player in music discovery and artist growth.\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How the TikTok Spotlight Series Addresses These Trends\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Nurturing Emerging Talent:**\n",
    "   - By featuring artists in a \"TikTok Spotlight Series,\" TikTok can help nurture emerging talent that may not have yet achieved mainstream recognition. This series would provide a platform for artists to share their stories, connect with audiences, and showcase their music beyond the viral moment. For example, short interviews about the inspiration behind their songs can help create a deeper connection with listeners.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Sustaining Engagement Post-Viral Success:**\n",
    "   - The decline in popularity seen in artists like Gera MX and Masked Wolf underscores the importance of continued engagement. The TikTok Spotlight Series can facilitate this by encouraging artists to create more content that resonates with their audience, such as behind-the-scenes clips, live performances, or interactive Q&A sessions. By keeping artists in the public eye, TikTok can help them maintain relevance and cultivate a dedicated fan base.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Bridging the Gap Between Platforms:**\n",
    "   - The series can also serve as a bridge to mainstream consumption by linking TikTok’s viral songs to streaming platforms like Spotify. Each episode can include direct calls to action, inviting viewers to listen to the featured artist's music on Spotify or other streaming services. This would not only promote the artist’s work but also encourage TikTok users to engage with the music outside the app, potentially increasing streams and chart positions on Billboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Creating a Sense of Community:**\n",
    "   - The TikTok Spotlight Series can foster a sense of community around the featured artists, encouraging fan participation through challenges or collaborative content. This approach can help sustain interest and engagement long after a song has gone viral, countering the decline in popularity seen in artists post-hit. \n",
